title: Joining the Lab
---

<h2>PhD Students</h2>

<p>
Our lab is always looking for talented PhD students, especially those that are
interested work at the intersection of distributed systems, databases, and
operating systems. To join, students must first be
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/application/">admitted to the School of
Computing at the University of Utah</a>. Interested, admitted students should
email Professor Stutsman.
</p>

<h2>Masters Students</h2>

<p>
Our lab has hosted several Masters students, though funding for research
assistantships are prioritized for PhD students. As a result, MS students are
generally expected to have some prior history with the lab before taking on
responsibilities within the lab. For example, MS students that successfully
contribute to the lab typically have taken a graduate course with Professor
Stutsman, and have shown aptitude in preliminary background work performed
as part of an independent study with him.
</p>

<h2>Undergraduate Students</h2>

<p>
Our lab has hosted several undergraduates in a variety of capacities, and
our lab generally tries to host one or two undergraduate researchers at a time.
Capacity to host students is necessarily capped to ensure students
receive enough attention to be successful, but, aside from undergraduate-level
experience in the area of computer systems, only limited background is needed.
Having prior contact with Professor Stutsman through his courses can
help provide a context to get started.
</p>

<p>
Generally, undergraduates working as part of our lab will initially work
alongside a graduate student, and multiple undergraduates have played key roles
in our research efforts. Professor Stutsman's research career was bootstrapped
through undergraduate research and mentoring by both faculty and graduate
students.  Undergraduates we host can often be paid when there is a
well-defined project they can work on either through NSF REUs or through Utah's
<a href="https://our.utah.edu/urop/">UROP program</a>.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of your interests or the lab's capacity to host students, if you are
interested in undergraduate research in <em>any capacity with any faculty at
Utah</em> please feel free to reach out to Professor Stutsman. He's always
happy to try to help you find ways to get connected to faculty and research at
Utah.
