<h3>Extending Low-latency Storage</h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud17/program/presentation/zhang">Splinter</a></span>
proposes using JIT-based runtimes for low-overhead fine-grained isolation and
pushing compute into low-latency, high-throughput databases.

<h3>Low-latency Live Migration</h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Rocksteady</span>
is a database live migration system for low-latency in-memory storage that
moves data an order of magnitude faster than existing systems while maintaining
tail latency bounds more than two orders of magnitude lower.

<h3><a href="./scale-out">Large-scale Systems Atop Scale-out In-memory Storage (NSF CNS 1566175)</a></h3>
<p>
Kernel-bypass and RDMA have resulted in fast, &mu;s-scale key-value stores.
Their performance comes from their simplicity, but applications are forced to
interact with data through an inefficient <tt>get()/put()</tt> interface.  This
project investigates raising the level of functionality that fast key-value
stores provide while preserving performance, a new model for programming them
using &mu;s-scale user-defined functions, and application of these stores for
building larger distributed systems.

<h3><a href="./splinter">Safe and Efficient Extensions for Low-Latency Multitenant Storage (NSF CNS 1750558)</a></h3>
<p>
<span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href="./splinter">Splinter</a></span> is
a new cloud in-memory key-value store that combats data movement between
disaggregated storage and compute nodes with untrusted tenant extensions that
are pushed to it at runtime.  Splinter's key insight is that storage
extensions can use language-level isolation to eliminate hardware isolation
overheads that cannot be avoided today: not with virtual machines, containers,
nor serverless Lambdas. Splinter also eliminates copying data for safety, so
extensions benefit from low-level hardware functionality like zero-copy network
transmission.

<h3>Flashield: A Hybrid Flash/DRAM Key-value Cache that Controls Flash Write Amplification</h3>
<p>
Using SSDs as a web cache subjects Flash to many small writes that wear out the
drive quickly. Flashield combats by using DRAM as both a cache and a
filter.  Items in DRAM are tracked to determine whether they are worth
preserving on Flash when they become colder.  Experiments show that Flashield
can reduce SSD write amplifciation by 5x compared to other approaches,
significantly extending the life of devices.

<h3>Rocksteady: Fast Data Migration for In-memory Key-value Stores</h3>

Kernel-bypass in-memory stores can perform millions of operations per second
per machine with tight response times less than 10 Î¼s. Rocksteady is a data
migration mechanism for in-memory stores that moves data quickly, retains low
tail response times, and doesn't rely on expensive in-memory redundancy.

<h3>Memshare: Multi-tenant In-memory Web Cache Sharing</h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc17/program/presentation/cidon">Memshare</a></span>
is a drop-in memcached replacment with first class support for multi-tenancy.
Memshare's unique combination of in-memory cleaning and online per-tenant hit
rate curve profiling give it better hit rates than exsiting caches even while
it allows the cache operator to control QoS, sharing, and isolation between
applications.
