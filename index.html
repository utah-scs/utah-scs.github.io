<h3>Extending Low-latency Storage</h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud17/program/presentation/zhang">Splinter</a></span>
proposes using JIT-based runtimes for low-overhead fine-grained isolation and
pushing compute into low-latency, high-throughput databases.

<h3>Low-latency Live Migration</h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Rocksteady</span>
is a database live migration system for low-latency in-memory storage that
moves data an order of magnitude faster than existing systems while maintaining
tail latency bounds more than two orders of magnitude lower.

<h3><a href="./splinter">Splinter/Sandstorm: Fine-grained Storage-level Functions for In-memory Stores</a></h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href="./splinter">Splinter</a></span> is
a new cloud in-memory key-value store that combats data movement between
disaggregated storage and compute nodes with untrusted tenant extensions that
are pushed to it at runtime.  Splinter's key insight is that storage
extensions can use language-level isolation to eliminate hardware isolation
overheads that cannot be avoided today: not with virtual machines, containers,
nor serverless Lambdas. Splinter also eliminates copying data for safety, so
extensions benefit from low-level hardware functionality like zero-copy network
transmission.

<h3>Flashield: A Hybrid Flash/DRAM Key-value Cache that Controls Flash Write Amplification</h3>

Today large scale web-cache operators do not deploy SSD for web caching. SSD
access times are sufficient, but web caches items are high churn. Using an SSD
as cache (or as a second-level cache for DRAM) still subjects Flash to many
small writes that wear out the drive quickly. Flashield combats this. It uses
DRAM as both a cache and a filter. Items in DRAM are tracked to determine
whether they are worth preserving on Flash when they become colder. Good
candidates are not just those that will be accessed in the future but which
also will not be modified for a sufficent duration. Beyond determining which
cached values are "flashworthy", Flashield also uses a new DRAM-conscious
scheme for index objects on Flash, since otherwise DRAM could be dominated
purely by location metadata for small items on large Flash SSDs. Experiments
show that Flashield can reduce SSD write amplifciation by 5x compared to other
approaches, significantly extending the life of devices.

<h3>Rocksteady: Fast Data Migration for In-memory Key-value Stores</h3>

Kernel-bypass in-memory stores can perform millions of operations per second
per machine with tight response times less than 10 Î¼s. Rocksteady is a data
migration mechanism for in-memory stores that moves data quickly, retains low
tail response times, and doesn't rely on expensive in-memory redundancy.

<h3>Memshare: Multi-tenant In-memory Web Cache Sharing</h3>

<span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc17/program/presentation/cidon">Memshare</a></span>
is a drop-in memcached replacment with first class support for multi-tenancy.
Memshare's unique combination of in-memory cleaning and online per-tenant hit
rate curve profiling give it better hit rates than exsiting caches even while
it allows the cache operator to control QoS, sharing, and isolation between
applications.

is a drop-in memcached replacement that incorporates flash as a second-tier for
superior hit rates and DRAM plus simple ML to extend SSD device life by more
than 40x compared to a naive victim cache approach.
